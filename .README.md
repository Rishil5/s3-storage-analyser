Quick notes while I am <strike>developing</strike> learning python

Project structure
=================
http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/structure/

Testing:
========
https://github.com/spulec/moto
http://echorand.me/replacing-boto-s3-mocks-using-moto-in-python.html

Libraries
=========
Tabulate and align: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tabulate/

Dont forget to add
==================
- A docker file
- A travis file for CI
- A public docker image in docker hub
- An AWS instance where all this is installed

More indexes than the one per bucket:
=====================================
By storage type
By storage and by region
By storage and by bucket

Async to process buckets in parallel
=========================================================
